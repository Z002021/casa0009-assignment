This website provides information on the biodiversity of England using data from the [Global Biodiversity Information Facility](https://www.gbif.org/occurrence/search).

### Analysis
Data was processed and analysed in Python, with the main analysis method being clustering (OPTICS and K-means).

### Backend
Data was uploaded to a MySQL database on the course server and REST API endpoints were created using Node.js.

### Frontend
The template for this website was obtained from Bootstrap Themes.

The interactive maps and visualisations were made using Plotly's JavaScript graphing library.
